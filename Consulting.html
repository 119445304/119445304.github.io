				   			<h1>What is Hyperautomation?</h1>
				   				<p>Hyperautomation brings together several components of process automation, integrating tools and technologies that amplify the ability to automate work.It starts with robotic process automation (RPA) at its core, and expands automation capability with artificial intelligence (AI), process mining, analytics, and other advanced tools.   
								The idea is to automate more and more knowledge work, and engage everyone in an organization to be part of the transformation.</p>
							<h2>Hyperautomation unlocks maximum potential for an automated enterprise</h2>
								<p>(1) <strong>Artificial intelligence capabilities</strong> such as machine learning (ML), natural languag processing (NLP), intelligent optical character recognition (OCR), and AI computer vision, so robots can read, see, and process more work. (2) <strong>Advanced analytics</strong> to measure and demonstrate the ROI of automation and its impact based on business outcomes that matter to your company.</p><a href="https://www.uipath.com/rpa/hyperautomation">Learn more about Hyperautomation</a><a href="#zero"><br>About us</br></a></p>

				   			<h1>What is Multiexperience?</h1>
				   				<p>Multiexperience is a concept pioneered by Gartner late in 2019. The concept is being championed as one of the biggest developments for 2020. In fact, Gartner states that “more than 25% of the mobile apps, progressive web apps and conversational apps at large enterprises will be built and/or run through a multiexperience development platform” by 2023.</p>
							<h2>What makes it consistent?</h2>
								<p>This isn’t just the same data and progress on all platforms (that can be solved with a properly organised backend system). Companies also need to consider their branding and style – what people expect from their company and its services, specifically. Your UX should be consistent, so that when customers migrate from device to device, they don’t need to learn entirely new navigation – everything should feel instantly familiar.</p><a href="https://www.pgs-soft.com/blog/what-is-multiexperience-why-does-it-matter/">Learn more about Multiexperience</a><a href="#zero"><br>About us</br></a></p>

				   			<h1>What is Distributed Cloud?</h1>
				   				<p>These early transitions to a cloudified edge and true multi-cloud are separate trends, but they are both part of a larger evolution toward the distributed cloud. The distributed cloud is an all new approach that will enable organizations to manage all disparate components – edge apps, apps stretched across multiple clouds, legacy datacenter apps, and the infrastructure that supports them all – as one logical cloud. This is the Holy Grail: being able to manage, operate and secure all these compute areas as a single, distributed cloud. That means deploying apps with a common set of policies and overarching visibility across all locations and heterogenous infrastructure.</p>
